// Part 3: Colorful T-Shirts
// Challenge:
// 1. Design a type alias named Product to represent a T-shirt object with properties like name
// (string), price (number), and color (string).
// 2. Include a nested object named inventory within Product. This inventory object 
// should have two properties: 
// o stock (number): Represents the number of T-shirts available.
// o colorOptions (optional array of strings): Lists available colors (if any).
// 3. Inside the inventory object, define a function named changeColor. This function 
// accepts a new color string as an argument. When called, it should: 
// o Update the color property of the Product object.
// o Adjust the price based on the new color (implement your own logic, e.g., 
// increase by 10% for red, decrease by 5% for blue)
export {};
// incomplete
// getting errors
